            <h1>Booya Days</h1>This is an annual event on our town's main street. We have all sorts of vendors for crafts,
            food, merchandise, and activities. The trademark of the event is the famous <em>Booya soup</em>, which is a soup
            that is served all day during the event (on a Saturday). As Darrel reports every year, <q>This is some of the
                best soup I have ever had, I look forward to it every year!</q> This just goes to show how many community
            members enjoy this event every year.</p>
            <p>Booya Days starts at 10:00 am on this Saturday on september 21st. Vendors usually start showing up to set up
                around 8:00 am, this helps give time for everyone to get set up and situated before customers start showing up.
                The event involves numerous community groups and members to make the event successful. There are many volunteers
                that help to serve the food including the Booya soup.

            <p>I am a vendor at Booya Days and will get there around 8:30 am to set up. It takes me about an hour to set up so I
                like to give myself a little extra time in case something goes wrong or if I forget something. Luckily I live
                only about ten minutes away from where the event is taking place so I will not have to wake up early. This also
                helps me to have time to run home if needed. But overall Booya Days is a great event to attend to help local
                small businesses, local organizations, and community members. I always look forward to it even with all the
                events I attend every year.
